(A Museum WAD to collect and tack my MAPPING Journey)
# NOX

G'Day aJynks here....

I've decided to start a new hobby making DOOM2 MODS.

This wad will be called NOX. The idea here is that I will be able to add, in an episodic way, individual, unrealted mapping projects inro a single wad. This wad will act as a kind of mueseum where map01 will be my 1st ever map, and the higher map number you go, the more (hopefully) better the maps become.

This very nature of this project means it is in a constant work in progress and will be going through a lot of changes... I'm not a programmer but have self-taught some coding stuff here and there, and as I learned modding this entire project may go through some massive changes.. so I get that it will be a total mess. Still, it is what it is!

Have Fun and SLAUGHTER DEMONS!<br>
